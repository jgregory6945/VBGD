<h1 id="top">Litter Announcements!</h1>
<p id="welp">We are excited to announce some updated breeding plans for our Spring 2020 litters!! <br>Be sure to visit parents page to view moms and dads.</p>
<h4 id="wel"><u>2/4/2020 Update:</u></h4>

<p id= "welp">-At this time all of the puppies that we have now have deposits placed on them.<br>
- We are planning an F1 and an F1b litter bred in April and ready for families early summer. We are taking deposits on these litters.<br>
*We will be breeding this week so check back to see who the parents will be :)</p><br>

<div class="para"  >
<p style="color:white; padding-top: 10px;">Our puppies are amazing, they will melt your heart.<br>

​Puppies are selected in deposit order, at our home, when they reach 4 weeks old. We then keep the puppies an additional 3-4 weeks to work with them on housebreaking, litter training, and socialization. We also provide tips and hints to help with training, and acclimating your puppy into your life.
Deposits on a puppy are $200. Typically there are 8 puppies per litter, although it is not uncommon to have more. Many times after the puppies are born more become available.
We are more than glad to help you select your puppy and will share our knowledge of temperaments, coats, etc... after all everyone is looking for something different in a puppy!!
 

Many of our puppies have gone on to to be service and therapy dogs, and of course, amazing family pets. It's common that after a family falls in love with their first VA beach goldendoodle, they come back for another!
Our goldendoodles are standard in size so typically our females are 55-ish pounds and our males are 65-ish pounds.
We have a Facebook group you can join by clicking on the Blue Facebook F on our website. There you can see pictures of puppies from our past litters and see what people are saying about us.
Again, dates are approximated as mother nature is in charge… Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
